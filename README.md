# Lua-LLM

Skeletal framework for creating a Large Language Model in the Lua programming
language.

**Note:**

By *skeletal*, I mean *ultra-minimal*. A lot of difficult, tedious work is
required to build a working model based on this framework. And all that work
is up to the cloner.

You have been warned. Good luck.
